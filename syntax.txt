Data Types:

-> Boolean - true | false
-> Integer - [-]?\d+
-> Decimal - [-]?\d+\.[\d+]{1,5}
-> Character - '[all characters]{1}'

Comments:

// -> Single line comment (anything written after // will be ignored)
/= =/ -> Multi line comment (anything written between ** ** will be ignored)

Syntax:

-> Entry Point

void main () {
    // Code
}

-> Variable Declaration

<datatype> <varname> = <varval> | <expr> | <varname>;

-> Assignment Statement

<varname> = <varval> | <expr> | <varname>;

-> Expression

<varname> <operator> <varname> | <varname> <operator> <varval> | <varval> <operator> <varname> | <varval> <operator> <varval>

:= Can be multiple operators in one expression and it is executed according to precendence =:

<expr> -> <expr> <operator> <literal>
<literal> -> <varname> | <varval>
<operator> -> + | - | * | / | % | ^

-> Operator

+ | - | * | / | % | ^ | =

:= Precedence =:
   high
    ^     ^ (exponentiation - right to left)
    |     % (modulus - left to right)
    |     * | / (multiplication and division - left to right)
    |     + | - (addition and subtraction - left to right)
    |     = (assignment - right to left)
   low

-> Input

scan(<varname>);

-> Output

log(<varname> | <varval> | <expr>);

Language Rules:
- The main entry point or the main function is the starting point of the program.
- The functions and global variables are defined outside the main entry point.
- Local variables can be defined inside any function.
- The main entry point is a function as well.
- Functions cannot be defined in other functions.
- The operators can be used with the respective data types only.
- The output function log() can be used to print the value of a variable or an expression.
- Every statement should end with a semicolon.
